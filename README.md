Flutter gridview UI layout
Explanation:
GridView.builder: This creates a scrollable grid of widgets, where the layout is defined by the SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount.
Cross Axis Count: You can set the number of columns in the grid by adjusting the crossAxisCount parameter.
Icons and Labels: We have a list of icons and corresponding labels. The itemBuilder creates a card for each icon, which contains an Icon widget and a Text widget.
Card: Each icon is wrapped in a Card widget to give it a raised appearance.
Usage:
You can run this code in a Flutter project, and it will display a grid of icons with labels underneath each icon. Feel free to modify the icons and labels according to your needs!
